        <h2 id="tips header">Fortnite Battle Royale Tips</h2>
        <p class="margin bigfont">Fortnite: Battle Royale, being the PvP aspect of Fortnite, presents players with a various number of ways in which they can be killed by the opposition. As if that weren't enough, the very nature of the map can do so to the inattentive rather quickly. Below is a collection of tips gathered from across the web and from personal experience that should help you reach victory royale.</p><hr>

        <!-- Basics -->
        <h2 id="basics">basics</h2>
        <p class="margin bigfont">1)  When crouching, your footsteps don't make as much noise. If you're planning on jumping someone close to you, crouch as you move towards so they cannot hear your footsteps.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">2)  You'll die frequently with the number of people on the map and the nature of the game. Rather than focusing on "winning", focus on your match duration and perfecting techniques.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">3)  Many of the player's actions make noise: running, sprinting, gathering, building, shooting, and using things like doors. Sprinting also leaves behind a dust trail. Be aware and have the volume up to know when players are around. This will prevent them from sneaking up on you.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">4)  Live to fight another day. Ambushing and patience is often the better way of taking out opponents.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">5)  Whenever possible, stay out of the open and use cover if you must move. Just remember that most cover can be destroyed.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">6)  If you come across a shield potion, use it quickly. You don't start out with a shield; if you have one, it will deplete before your health.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">7)  Shields protect from most weapons and traps. It does not protect you from the storm, fall damage, stink bombs nor poison dart traps.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">8)  You can gain shield points by drinking a small shield potion, Shield Potion, Slurp Juice (gain 75 health or shield over a period of time) or a Chug Jug which restores 100 health and shield points. Mushrooms give 5 shield points and coconuts can give up to 5 shield points if you are full health.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">9)  On the flip side, save some of those health-restoring items for later in the game.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">10)  Players start with max (100) health.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">11)  Bandages return 15 a piece, but don't heal over 75. They take 3.5 seconds to consume.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">12)  Med Kits and Chug Jugs can heal to max no matter what degree of damage players have taken. A Chug Jug takes 15 seconds to consume whilst a Med Kit takes 10.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">13)  Drink small shields before a shield potion, this will allow you to have 100 shields. They take 2 seconds to consume.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">14)  You do take fall damage, but you can quickly build structures beneath you to halt your descent if you have something to build off.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">15)  If you happen to come across a player fortification, such as a tower, it might be best to avoid it. The player who built it likely has most of the advantages when it comes to a confrontation, including the high ground, scoped weaponry, and cover. Approach with caution.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">16)  Building with the same material as another fort negates the noise made by your structure. Use this to rush 1 x 1 bases with ease.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">17)  In Squad or Duo mode, try not to get knocked down as you lose all your shield, and if revived, you will have only 30 HP.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">18)  Other situations where caution is advised is when looting players and nearing loot drops. Enemies will typically hear or know the locations, so you can hang back and wait to either make sure no one else is approaching or use it as an opportunity to ambush others.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">19)  Players building tall structures are at risk of the bottom being destroyed and the rest of the tower disappearing, leaving the players on it vulnerable to fall damage. Be wary of this when building, but also use this to your advantage when you see other player's buildings. You can set up a launch pad before your building is destroyed and use it to escape, or use a Glider Redeploy to avoid falling damage. If you have no weapons, the pickaxe will do 20 damage per hit.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">20)  If you get stressed out about not winning, take a deep breath, and repeat after me. “I will not win every time. If I want to win I must work on my skills.” Followed by more deep breathing before starting a match. Good luck.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">21)  If you wish that you had special skins, gliders, emotes, contrails, then buy the battle pass, it’s only 950 V-Bucks and you get LOADS OF COOL STUFF! If you manage to reach tier 100, you will end up with 6 awesome skins, too many emotes to count, and 4 contrails, and a ton of V-bucks, so you can buy the next battle pass with no real money! It’s an outstanding deal, so take a look. Plus, you will have up to 500 V-Bucks per battle pass. (Note: remember, you need to EARN the rewards by playing the game).</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">22)  If you're not sure where where the safe zone will be, activate glider(while the storm is forming) and do nothing. This will lower your risk of getting killed and the risk of landing in the storm's range.</p><hr>

        <!-- Landing -->
        <h2 id="landing">Landing</h2>
        <p class="margin bigfont">1)  The first big decision players will make is where to land once they depart from the bus.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">2)  Landing as far as possible does mean you would be less likely to get killed or shot, but doesn't help with improving skill.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">3)  Land at popular locations or jump out at the start of the bus path if you want some action.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">4)  Weapons are found mainly inside buildings, so target those areas.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">5)  Be cautious when dropping to buildings, other players will have a similar plan, and areas with buildings typically attract more players than areas without. There are trade-offs of choosing areas with more items and players, or areas with fewer players but less items. Pick your position.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">6)  Deploy the glider sooner rather than later in order to fall slowly and cover more distance. This allows you to scout out where others might be landing in order to avoid early confrontations. However, if you do decide to do this then chances are other people will have landed there and gotten a weapon. Even if you are gliding you are not invulnerable.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">7)  When you decide on an area to land deploy the glider as late you can and slightly away from the area you are trying to reach. Then glide at an angle to the place you want to land. This will get you to the ground quicker than gliding straight down. If you use a volcano vent on your way down, it will allow you to deploy your glider closer to the ground than normal.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">8)  Instead of going to populated areas, try to tackle less populated places as hardly any players landing means all the loot is to yourself.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">9)  To get somewhere far away from the Battle Bus, spam the deploy glider button and you can go further.</p><hr>

        <!-- The Map -->
        <h2 id="the map">The Map</h2>
        <p class="margin bigfont">1)  Take note of the direction of travel the bus makes during the drop-off phase. Players will be landing at spots along or near this line and spreading out from there.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">2)  Pay attention to where the storm circle is on the map; players won't last long outside of it.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">3)  Knowing where the ever-shrinking circle edges are is helpful, as players will need to move away from it.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">4)  One late-game strategy is to keep the storm at your back. By doing this, you can be sure that players will not attack you from behind (due to the storm killing them).</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">5)  One early-game strategy is to maintain a position at the edge of the storm, moving around the circle and picking off players as they attempt to make their way to safety.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">6)  To check where the bus is going, you can check the map before the bus takes off, and you can see an arrow pointing to that direction.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">7)  The storm will usually do one damage every second and the damage ascends the longer it is into the game. Shields are useless as the storm cannot do damage to shields but instead will chip away your health.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">8)  Depending on the distance to the circle, the storm can be much faster or slower than the player - the further you are from the new circle's edge, the faster the storm moves.</p><hr>


        <!-- Environment -->
        <h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>
        <p class="margin bigfont">1)  Close doors after using them to avoid tipping off players as to your location. To the unwary opponent, this can also serve as a useful ambush if you're waiting on the other side.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">2)  Tires and fire hydrants can launch you into high places, but if you don't reach the position you are trying to get to, it could result in loss of health or death.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">3)  Checking above you can be of vital importance. You could find player-built structures and can check the tops of mountains for players.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">4)  Check a room for traps before entering. A common trap is a damage trap on a roof.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">5)  If hiding in a bush, note that some weapons, when equipped will poke out more, giving away your position. Also, if on a slope, you can be seen hiding in it from certain angles. If using the equip-able bush, pay special attention to your surrounding when moving.</p>
        <p class="margin bigfont">6)  In certain biomes, there are different consumables that are lying on the ground. Some give different boosts.</p>







        <h2 id="cross-platform">Cross-platform play</h2>
        <p class="margin bigfont">For the first five seasons, all ports of Fortnite Battle Royale support cross-platform play with other versions, but with limited interaction in regards to the PlayStation 4. That is, players on personal computer and mobile versions can cross-play with Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users, or alternatively they can cross-play with PlayStation 4 users. While Epic Games has expressed interest in having full cross-platform play across all available platforms, Sony's continued refusal to allow cross-play between the PlayStation 4 and other consoles rendered this impossible, according to Microsoft. Further, while players can use a single Epic Games account to share progress in Fortnite Battle Royale on all other platforms, those who used their PlayStation Network credentials to establish their Epic account cannot use that account on other platforms. The account restriction was confirmed to be as a result of Sony's initial decision to prohibit cross-platform play between its PlayStation 4 and other consoles, rather than a choice Epic had made.</p>

        <p class="margin bigfont">By September 2018, Sony had made a decision to allow cross-platform play for the PlayStation 4 for "select third-party titles", starting with Fortnite. A beta version of the PlayStation 4 client supporting this was released for the game on September 26, 2018, the same day as Sony's announcement. Tools to merge multiple Epic accounts as well as unlinking console accounts from an Epic account to attach to another were released in February 2019. The first full patch adding in cross-platform play support across all consoles was released in March 2019.</p>

        <p class="margin bigfont">Solo mobile players, or squads entirely consisting of mobile players will play solely with other mobile players by default for fairness; players however can use cross-platform play to join squads on other platforms, and matchmaking will consider all available matches. With the March 2019 for cross-platform play, the game will similar matchmake PlayStation 4 and Xbox One users by default to avoid these players being at a disadvantage against computer users.</p><hr>
